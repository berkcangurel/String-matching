This program compares the speed of four different string matching algorithms on a given string and pattern pair.

Included algorithms:
- [Brute Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String-searching_algorithm#Na%C3%AFve_string_search)
- [Knuth–Morris–Pratt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm)
- [Boyer–Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_string-search_algorithm)
- [Rabin–Karp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm)

###### Usage

`./string_search string_file pattern_file`

*string_file* is the text file that contains the string that will be searched (the haystack), whereas *pattern_file* is the text file that contains the pattern to be searched (the needle).
